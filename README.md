# Deprecation Notice
### This project is no longer maintained.
It was a lot of fun building this for [Reversim Summit 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNk-Kz_WqdY)
I've moved on to other technologies... About a dozen people wrote to me over the years thanking for this project, I hoped it helped you too somehow :)

# ember-admin-dashboard
This project's goals:
* "Emberize" the very awesome [AdminLTE template](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE) including Ember-Cli.
* Show a demo implementation of a realtime dashboard pulling data from the twitter stream api with socket.io
* 1 click deploy to Heroku (will work with github forks and clones as well):
